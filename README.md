# S3 Glob Sync

> Sync globs with AWS S3.

## About

This action works with any S3-compatible service like [Digital Ocean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/) or [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and allows you to sync globs with it.

### How it works

This action has 2 modes: `upload` and `download`.

In `upload` mode you should provide a list of patterns and a prefix and all the files matching the patterns will be uploaded to the S3 bucket, with the proper prefix.

In `download` mode you should provide a prefix and a destination folder. All the objects prefixed with that prefix will be downloaded to the desired destination folder.

Note that this action will not delete your objects or files in any case.
